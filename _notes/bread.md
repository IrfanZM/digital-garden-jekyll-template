title: Bread
---

The starting point for my bread.

1. [[The regular bread recipes]]
2. Experimental recipes in the works
3. Recipes I want to try, but haven't yet

Goals:

I think I'm aiming for the following to have nailed down:
- Standard, quick white bread and wholemeal bread
- White sourdough
- Rye sourdough
- A dessert bread/cinnamon roll kind of thing
- 3 or 4 "fancy" breads
  - Including a braided bread
