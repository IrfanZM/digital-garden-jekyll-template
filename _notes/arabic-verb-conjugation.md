## Conjugation rules <a name="conjugation_rules"></a>

These rules describe 'post-justified' rules, in that they have been created to best *explain* the irregular conjugations as found in the arabic language. They are *not* the rules that these irregular verb forms are conjugated in accordance to, and therefore may not always work.

### Rule 1

Whenever you see a vowelled weak letter, preceded by a fathah, you turn the weak letter into an alif.

قَوَلَ - قَالَ
هَدَيَ - هَدَا

### Rule 2

Avoiding two sukuns - where you see two sukuns next to each other, you drop the first.

أَتَيتْ - أَتَتْ
هَدَيُوْا - هَدَاوْا - هَدَوْا

### Rule 3

Weak letters disappear at the first sign of trouble! If there is a sakin alif before a dual feminine, and preceded by a fathah, then drop it.



### Rule 4

### Rule 5
