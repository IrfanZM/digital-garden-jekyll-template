## Definite and indefinite <a name="definite"></a>

- ال is used to indicate the definite article in arabic. In adding the ال you drop the tanwin that you normally have at the end of an indefinite word. You can't have them both together!
- Whether or not you pronounce the ل, or you join straight onto the the next letter with a shaddah depends on whether the first letter of the word is a sun or a moon letter.

## Nouns and noun sentences <a name="noun_sentences"></a>

- When using adjectives to describe nouns, they have to agree on the following four elements:
  1. Definition
  2. Gender
  3. Case ending
  4. Numbers
- To create a complete sentence, you need something that contains complete information, and not just a fragment.
- [D + I = NS] Putting a definite and indefinite word together forms a complete sentence. For example:

 القمرُ جَميلٌ - The moon is beautiful

- Questions can be asked by constructing the sentence in the usual way, and then placing either a هَلْ or a أ at the start of the sentence. Where the alif joins another alif, you should elide the first alif, e.g. آلقمر جميل؟. When the ل of the هَلْ joins onto ال, the first lam should take a kasrah to allow joining, e.g. هَلِ الْولد جديد.

## Masculine and feminine <a name="masculine"></a>

- Words, اسم are split into masculine and feminine. There are three kinds of feminine words:
  1. Biologically feminine. These are words like mother, daughter, bride, etc.
  2. Feminine by design. These are words that you can make feminine, typically by adding  the ta marbuta (ة). This applies mostly to adjectives, and you cannot do this to nouns - they are already inherently feminine or masculine. If there is a ة at the end of the word, you can assume 99% of the time that it is feminine.
  3. Feminine by convention. These applies to categories of words, like:
    * Geographical names
    * Body parts in pairs.
  4. Feminine for no apparent reason. These are ones you have to learn. Examples are شمس, ارض, نفس.
- Remember that the gender of the adjective has to follow the gender of the noun.

## Case endings <a name="case_endings"></a>

- A word will have a fixed spelling, but its case ending (the vowel on the last letter) will not be fixed. This varies depending on the case of the word, and is called اِعْراب.
- There are three possible states for case endings:
  1. رَفْعٌ - also called the nominative state. Ending is -ُ or -ٌ
  2. نَصْبٌ - also called the accusative state. Ending is -َ or -ً
  3. جَرٌّ - also called the genitive state. Ending is -ِ or -ٍ
- Certain case endings are caused, and others are 'default'.
- There are over 100 causative agents, and they all have subcategories. As an example, 17 of these agents are prepositions.
- Prepositions always render the following word in the j-state. For example:

 مِنَ البَيتِ القديمِ - from the small house

## Possession <a name="possession"></a>

- This is known as إِضافة.
- There are several rules for possession:
  1. No ال on the first word.
  2. No tanwin on the first word.
  3. Kasrah on the second word (the possessor), which is the جر state.
- Examples are:

 بَيتُ الرَّخُلِ- The man's house.\
 نُورُ اللّه- The light of Allah.

- When adding another adjective onto the possessor, or the possessed, you need to make sure you agree with the definite/indefinite article, and the case ending.

كتابُ الطالبِ الجديدِ - The new student's book.\
كتابُ الطالبِ الجديدُ - The student's new book.

- Despite not having a tanwin on it, the 'book' above is definite, as it is known.
- For indefinite words, you would use -ٍ

 كتابُ طالبٍ - A student's book.

- Names of places and foreign places have different case endings due to being diptotes.
- This means they don't take -ِ or -ً

 فِ مكةَ - In Makkah


## Plurals <a name="plural"></a>
