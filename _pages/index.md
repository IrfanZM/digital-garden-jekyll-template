# Welcome! 🌱

<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
  Take a look at <span style="font-weight: bold">[[Your first note]]</span> to get started on your exploration.
</p>

Here's a list of current topics:

- [[bread]]

And here are the topics I need to add:

- photography
- ethical living
- arabic language
- modelling and analysis
- nooks
- baking

This digital garden template is free, open-source, and [available on GitHub here](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template).

This is my [[bread]] note.
